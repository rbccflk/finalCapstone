# finalCapstone

## Here is the code for my fourth capstone project, inventory.py. 

## This program uses object-oriented programming to create a shoe inventory.
# 
For each shoe in the inventory, the following information is available:
    
    Country, code, product name, cost, quantity, value

The user is able to do the following: 

    Search products by code;
    Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it;
    Determine the product with the highest quantity;
    Calculate the total value of each stock item

## Using this file

### **Searching products by code**
